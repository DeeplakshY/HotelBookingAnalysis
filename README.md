The Hotel Booking Demand & Cancellations Analysis project is focused on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover patterns in customer behavior and cancellations. It helps hotels understand which bookings are more likely to be canceled, what times of year are busier, and which hotel types or customer segments have higher demand.

Context

Hotels often face challenges like last-minute cancellations, fluctuating demand, and uneven occupancy rates. By analyzing historical booking data, hotel managers can make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue, improve occupancy, and reduce losses due to cancellations.

What the Project Does

Data Loading: Reads raw hotel booking datasets containing information such as booking dates, customer types, arrival details, and cancellation status.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removes duplicates, handles missing values, and prepares the data for analysis.

Analysis Ready: Saves processed data for further exploration, reporting, or predictive modeling.

Future Extension: The cleaned dataset can be used to generate insights like:

Which months have the highest booking demand

Cancellation trends across hotel types

Average lead time for bookings

Popular customer segments

Why This Project Matters

For Hotels: Helps in managing bookings, forecasting demand, and reducing cancellations.

For Analysts: Demonstrates skills in Python, data cleaning, and basic exploratory analysis.

For Future Work: Can be extended to predict cancellations, build dashboards, or automate reporting.
