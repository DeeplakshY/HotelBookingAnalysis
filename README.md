# Hotel Booking Demand & Cancellations Analysis

**Project Overview**  
The **Hotel Booking Demand & Cancellations Analysis** project analyzes historical hotel booking data to uncover patterns in customer behavior and cancellations. It helps hotels understand which bookings are more likely to be canceled, identify peak demand periods, and optimize operations.  

**Context**  
Hotels often face challenges like last-minute cancellations, fluctuating demand, and uneven occupancy rates. By analyzing historical data, hotel managers can make **data-driven decisions** to improve occupancy, increase revenue, and reduce losses due to cancellations.  

**What the Project Does**  
- **Data Loading:** Reads raw hotel booking datasets including booking dates, customer types, arrival details, and cancellation status.  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Removes duplicates, handles missing values, and prepares the data for analysis.  
- **Processed Data:** Saves cleaned datasets for further exploration, reporting, or predictive modeling.  
- **Analysis Insights:** Enables exploration of trends such as:
  - Months with the highest booking demand  
  - Cancellation trends across hotel types  
  - Average lead time for bookings  
  - Popular customer segments  

**Why This Project Matters**  
- **For Hotels:** Helps manage bookings, forecast demand, and reduce cancellations.  
- **For Analysts:** Demonstrates skills in **Python, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- **Future Extensions:** Can be used to build **predictive models for cancellations**, interactive dashboards, or automated reporting.
